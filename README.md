## Background

I first started taking interest in Artificial Intelligence in 2020/2021. I was very scared of it at first, as I only saw the negative aspects. In late 2021, I started planning to work with it. Starting in 2023, I started making actual AI projects, starting with [:octocat: `AI2001`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AI2001/) as I wanted to create a flexible, open source AI dataset and engine.

This section is incomplete.
